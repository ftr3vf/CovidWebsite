            <h1>Antibody Test</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Antibody tests detect the presence of COVID-19 in serum (the clear part of blood),
              and mucuous secretions like saliva.
            </p>
            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The COVID-19 antibody test is NOT currently 
                recommended for use in diagnosing COVID or testing for COVID immunity</li>
              <li>Only tests for the presence of antibodies to viral antigens like the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein</li>
              <li>Antibody presence can be detected within days (up to weeks) following COVID infection/vaccination</li>
              <li>Thus it cannot determine the presence or absence of COVID at time of test</li>
              <li>A positive result means the testee has COVID (and rarely other coronaviruses) antibodies from either a previous infection or vaccination.
               This is due to the vaccines construction to encode the S protein</li>
               <li>Antibody tests tend to have higher false positive rates, as other coronaviruses can encode the proteins that the test looks for</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Types of Antibody Testing</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Binding Antibody Tests</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Using purified proteins from SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID), it attempts to detect the IgG, IgM and IgA antibody types.
              IgM can be used to determine recent infections, but becomes undetectable after weeks to months. IgG is usually detectable longer, and IgA can be detected 
              in both mucuous and blood, but it's significance is still to be determined. There are two general types of binding antibody tests: POC and Laboratory tests</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Point-of-care (POC)</h4>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Provides results within minutes using lateral flow immunoassay devices to detect antibodies in serums, plasma,
                or blood using a blood prick
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Laboratory</h4>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Uses lateral flow, ELISA, or chemiluminescent immunoassay methods to detect antibodies in blood, plasma, or serum.
                 Can require trained laboratory scientists and specialized instruments.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Neutralizing Antibody Detection</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Uses a test tube or culture dish to check for antibodies to COVID-19</li>
              <li>3 categories of neutralization tests:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Virus neutralization tests: uses reporter proteins for COVID and the results can take up to 5 days</li>
                <li>Pseudovirus neutralization tests: involves a recombinant pseudovirus (a virus that incorporates the S protein of COVID-19)
                   to test for antibody presence
                </li>
                <li>Surrogate neutralization tests: does not require a culture, and also forgoes the need for using native viral particles. Can easily be adapted to the 
                  ELISA antibody detection format
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
