            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>- Antigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which indicates current viral infection. </p>
            <p>- Antigen tests take approximately 15-30 minutes but are less sensitive to viral load detection as compared to PCR and NAAT tests.  </p>
            <p>- Antigen tests due to their rapid results and better success than NAAT tests are used typically for screening purposes in identifying quickly those who have the Covid 19 strain </p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <br>

            <div id='performance'>
            <h3>Performance</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>- “Gold standard” is to follow up antigen results that have inconsistent results with clinical context with a laboratory based NAAT test.  </p>
            <p>- The antigen level in specimens collected either before symptom onset, or late in the course of infection, may be below the tests’ limit of detection, resulting in a false negative antigen test result, while a more sensitive test, such as most NAATs, may return a positive result  </p>
            <p>- The specificity of antigen tests is comparable to NAATs, which means that false positive test results are unlikely when an antigen test is used according to the manufacturer’s instructions </p>
            <p>- Positive and negative values depend on the pretest probability. </p>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
              <p>- Pretest probability considers both the prevalence of the target infection in the population that is being tested as well as the clinical context of the individual being tested. </p>
              <p>- Meaning if there is high prevalence in the community and the patient is symptomatic then the pretest probability is high </p>
            </div>
            </div>
            </div>

            <div id='results'>
            <h3>Evaluating Results</h3>
            <div id='performance' style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <p>- When evaluating the results of antigen testing, the performance characteristics, instructions for use of the test, and prevalence of Covid infection in the community need to be considered. </p>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
              <p>- Performance characteristics include sensitivity and specificity </p>
              <p>- Prevalence of Covid infection includes the number of cases in the community relative to the population size </p>
            </div>
            <p>- Should also consider whether the person has experience symptoms and for how long  </p>
            <p>- Sensitivity of the current antigen test varies, so negative diagnostic testing results should be handled depending on the circumstances </p>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
              <p>- In most circumstances, the manufacturers’ instructions for use of antigen tests show that negative test results should be considered “presumptive” meaning that the results are preliminary </p>
            </div>
            <p>- It is recommended to confirm antigen test results with a laboratory-based NAAT that’s been evaluated against the FDA reference panel for analytical sensitivity </p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <div id='advantages'>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>- Moderate to high sensitivity during peak viral load </p>
            <p>- High specificity  </p>
            <p>- Relatively easy to use </p>
            <p>- Quick turnaround time </p>
            <p>- Relatively Cheap ($5 - $30) </p>
            <p>- Comparable performance to other tests such as PCR and NAATs in symptomatic individuals </p>

            </div>

            <div id='disadvantages'>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>- May need confirmatory testing </p>
            <p>- Less sensitive than NAATs and PCR tests (viral load needs to reach peak to be comparable in sensitivity) </p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <br>
            <br>

            <div id='sympto'>
            <h3>Testing Symptomatic Individuals in a Community</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>- When testing a person who has symptoms compatible with Covid, it can be interpreted that the person will get a positive antigen test indicating the person have covid  </p>
            <p>- A positive antigen test result for a symptomatic person generally does not require confirmatory testing </p>
            <p>- It can be considered if the person has a lower chance of a covid infection </p>
            <p>- A negative antigen test result for a symptomatic person should generally be confirmed with a laboratory test </p>
            <p>- In this scenario, serial antigen testing conducted ever 2-3 days while symptomatic can be used as an alternative</p>
            <p>- A negative antigen test result for a symptomatic person may not require a confirmatory laboratory test if the person has a lower chance of a covid infection (see above)</p>
            <p>- A symptomatic person who has received a negative antigen test result and a positive confirmatory NAAT should follow CDC’s guidelines for isolation from the date of the first test </p>
            <p>- A symptomatic person who has received a negative antigen and a negative NAAT should seek alternative diagnoses and avoid close contact with others </p>

            <div id='asympto'>
            <h3>Testing Asymptomatic Individuals in a Community</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>- A positive antigen test from an asymptomatic person is generally interpreted as infected with covid  </p>
            <p>- A positive antigen test on a person with a low likelihood of covid should confirm through NAAT testing</p>
            <p>- A negative antigen test result from an asymptomatic person is generally interpreted as not infected with covid </p>
            <p>- However a negative antigen test result may need confirmatory testing through NAAT if the person has a higher likelihood of covid infection </p>
            <p>- A higher likelihood of covid infection would include a person who has had close contact or suspected exposure to a person who has covid</p>
            <p>- If an asymptomatic person who tested negative on an antigen test suspects they had close contact or suspected exposure to a person with covid should follow CDC’s guidelines for quarantine</p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <br>

            <div id='vaccinated'>
            <h3>Antigen Testing for Vaccinated Individuals</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>- The CDC states the Antigen Testing Guidelines consider those who are up to date with their vaccines and those who are not </p>
            <p>- This is because the antigen tests check for active diseases instead of immunity</p>
            <p>- False positive rates are mostly unaffected for vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals. This is because false positives are due to how tests are administered rather than the viral load. False positive occurrences have decreased post vaccination but this is due to less frequent testing.  </p>
