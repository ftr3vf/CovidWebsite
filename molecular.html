              <div style="margin-left: 25px">
              <p>- Molecular tests detect the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, the genetic material.</p>
              <p>- This test is also known as a PCR test because it uses the real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</p>
              <p>- A saliva or nasal sample is needed for this test and results take about 1 or more days.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Terminology</h3>
              <div style="margin-left: 25px">
                <ul>
                  <li>Primers: short, single-stranded DNA sequence that matches a specific area of viral genome,  
                    attaches to viral DNA, and defines that region of the DNA that will be amplified. Researchers find unique parts of the genome to build primers.</li>
                  <li>Amplification: make more copies of the viral DNA.</li>
                  <li>Reverse transcription: Translate RNA to DNA. Why convert? Because the SARS-COV-2 genome is made of RNA, it's less stable 
                    and more sensitive to UV radiation and breakdown by enzymes than DNA however.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              </div>

            <div id='detection'>
              <h3>Detection</h3>
              <div style="margin-left: 25px">
                <ol>
                  <li>Reverse transcription is needed for most PCR tests. Detect genetic material (DNA or RNA) specific to the pathogen. The primers attach themselves to the viral part of the genome.
                    This is the backbone for the amplification of that genome. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Amplify detected region of the genetic material of the virus. <br>
                    The area where the primer is attached is amplified in repeated cycles. This process closely mimics natural DNA replication processes in all human cells.
                    The process relies on programmed temperature changes which encourage the double stranded DNA to fall apart, allow replication enzymes to create a new copy of the DNA, and then close the newly formed strands together.
                    Because of this requirement, amplification cycles usually take place in machines called “thermocyclers” that can be specified for number of iterations, temperature, and cycle timing.
                    There are also isothermal methods that do not require heating to amplify.
                  </li>
                  <li>Amplfication helps to visualize the virus within the sample.
                  </li>
                </ol>

              <h3>Types of Tests + Pros and Cons</h3>
              <div style="margin-left: 25px">
                <ol>
                  <li>Real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-qPCR): Identifies and quantifies the presence of infectious agents in a sample through the process of detection, amplification, and output measurement.
                    <br>
                    PROS: specific, can be modified as virus evolves to fit new iterations
                    Hundreds of samples can be run at once, extremely sensitive
                    <br>
                    CONS: needs trained people, 1-3 hrs, undergo RNA extraction before running the test. Should not be repeated within 90 days, may continue to have detectable RNA after risk of transmission has passed.
                  </li>
                  <li>Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP): Rapid amplification of viral genomic material with a color or light-based readout, performed at a single temperature, unlike rRT-PCR.
                    <br>
                    Pros: Requires a single temperature only, rapid (minutes to results), highly sensitive and specific to defined SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
                    <br>
                    Cons: Primer design must be exact, incorrectly folded primers can interfere with the reaction, difficult to quantify virus. Samples must undergo RNA extraction before the test can be run, adding another 1 to 2 hours. Should not be repeated within 90 days, may continue to have detectable RNA after risk of transmission has passed.
                  </li>
                  <li>Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA): Detects DNA sequences through precise matches of an enzyme called recombinase that can pull apart (displace) DNA strands and then amplify specific viral genes.
                    Pros: Requires a single temperature only, rapid, less equipment required, highly sensitive and specific to defined SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
                    Cons: Primer design must be exact, can be difficult to quantify virus, and debris can interfere with reaction. Samples must undergo RNA extraction before the test can be run, adding another 1 to 2 hours. Should not be repeated within 90 days, may continue to have detectable RNA after risk of transmission has passed.

                <h3>Test Sensitivity</h3>
                <div style="margin-left: 25px">
                  <ul>
                    <li>None of the tests currently used has absolute sensitivity because there is no gold standard for testing.</li>
                    <li>Clinical performance approved by the FDA has defined a minimum of 95% positive and negative agreement</li>
                    <h5>False Negatives</h5>
                    <li>False negative results are ncommon for a PCR test</li>
                    <li>According a UC Health professional, a false negative result can only occur with a very low viral load</li>
                    <br>
                    Someone may have a very low viral load in the first couple days after they have become infected. The viral load can also be low at the end of the infection.
                    <h5>False Positives</h5>
                    <li>More common of an occurence for two types of common problems: contamination and determining cut-off for if a specimen is positive</li>
                    <li>Hard to distinguish between a low viral load versus being indeterminate</li>
                    <li>Contamination can occur during sampling, extraction, PCR amplification, and the production of lab reagents</li>
                  </ul>
